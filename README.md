AUX Pre-work - Build an Address Book
===
This was the pre-work for the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil. Using Tim Wright's "Learning Javascript," I coded this first to just work in raw Javascript, then with jQuery, and then turned it into a plugin. As "extra credit," I loaded in mustache.js and used that to keep all HTML out of the Javascript file.
